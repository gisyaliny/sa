    "### Key Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Population Size ($N$): Total number of units in the population.\n",
    "- Sample Size ($n$): Number of units to be sampled.\n",
    "- Confidence Level: Typically 90%, 95%, or 99%.\n",
    "- Margin of Error ($e$): The maximum error allowed in the sample estimate.\n",
    "- Standard Deviation ($σ$): Variability of the population. If unknown, it can be estimated.\n",
    "- Z-Score ($Z$): Corresponds to the chosen confidence level (e.g., 1.96 for 95%).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Central Limit Theorem (CLT)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The CLT states that, for a **sufficiently large** sample size, the sampling distribution of the **sample mean** will be approximately **normally distributed**, regardless of the shape of the population distribution.\n",
    "  _ Mean of this normal distribution **equals to the population mean ($\\mu$)**\n",
    "  _ The standard deviation (Standard error of the mean, $SEM$) is determined by both the standard deviation of the population ($\\sigma$) and sample size\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "SEM=\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Margin of Error and Confidence Interval\n",
    "\n",
    "- The margin of error ($e$) is half the width of this confidence interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "e = Z* SEM \\to e = Z*\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\to n = \\frac{Z^2*\\sigma^2}{e^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- $Z$: the Z-score representing the confidence level.\n",
    "- $σ$: the population standard deviation.\n",
    "- $e$: the desired margin of error.\n"
